                <h4>Just keep going!</h4>
                <p>The hardest part about doing anything is actually doing it. Everything takes time, patience, and effort; and how do you know it will be worth it in the end? How do you know if you shouldnt spend your time doing something else that might yield a better result?</p>

                <p>Keep going. Doubt, fear, lethargy are all common when tackling new challenges and breaking out of normal routine and whats comfortable. If you keep going though, if you keep learning and working you can calm the doubt, forget the fear, and develop a new work ethic in you newly developed routine. </p>

                <h4>Don't be hard on yourself</h4>
                <p>If you consider yourself of average intelligence then you are already smarter than half the world's population. You probably also realize that the only person you are always with is yourself. So do not be so hard on yourself. Be kind, patient, and ready to learn with yourself. </p>

                <p>Love yourself and keep learning!</p>
